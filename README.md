# Tensor-Factorization-HOSVD-iterative


Iterative HOSVD algorithm to decompose tensor and find its Singular factors in each mode

#Usage

Execute Main_HOSVD to run the experiment.
Requires Tensor Toolbox, can be found at http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.6.html

# Parameters to change factorization settings
 1. index             :   number of training samples --- Line-4
 2. Rank_#            :   Rank of the core tensor required --- Line-10
 3. Max_iterations    :   Allowable Number of iterations for convergence --- Line-11
 4. Error_Threshold   :   Allowable Error Tolerance in decomposition --- Line-12
